## Code Architecture Guidelines

### PHP Development
- Use OOP with simple MVC-style structure
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards when implementing
- Database interactions through prepared statements (mysqli)
- Single responsibility principle for classes
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Database Design Principles
- Normalized tables (3NF minimum)
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- Lot tracking capabilities from the start
- UTC timestamps for all date/time fields
- Soft deletes where appropriate (deleted_at field)

### Key Database Tables
**Phase 1 (Core MRP):**
- `materials` - Raw materials (resins, inserts, packaging)
- `products` - Finished goods with part numbers
- `bom_headers` & `bom_details` - Bill of Materials structure
- `inventory` - Current stock levels with lot tracking
- `customer_orders` - Customer order management

**Phase 2 (Production Scheduling):**
- `work_centers` - Machines, assembly stations, work areas
- `work_center_calendar` - Shift schedules and availability
- `production_routes` - Manufacturing sequences per product
- `production_orders` - Manufacturing orders from customer demand
- `production_order_operations` - Detailed operation scheduling
- `production_order_materials` - Material reservations
- `production_order_status_history` - Status change tracking

**Phase 3+ (Purchasing & ERP):**
- `purchase_orders` - Supplier orders (planned)
- `suppliers` - Supplier management (ready)
- `financial_transactions` - Cost tracking (planned)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start local development server
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/

# MySQL database access
mysql -u root -p mrp_erp

# Check PHP syntax
php -l filename.php

# Run PHP built-in linter on all files
find . -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \;
```

## Testing Approach

- Manual testing through web interface initially
- Database transaction testing for MRP calculations
- Test with realistic manufacturing scenarios:
  - Multi-level BOMs
  - Inventory shortages
  - Production scheduling conflicts

## Key Implementation Notes

### MRP Calculation Logic
1. Accept customer order input (product + quantity)
2. Explode BOM recursively for all components
3. Calculate gross requirements
4. Compare against current inventory
5. Generate net requirements (shortages)
6. Suggest purchase orders for materials

### Mobile-First UI Requirements
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly form controls
- Minimal JavaScript dependencies
- Fast page loads (< 2 seconds)
- Works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- Tooltips on all form fields that need guidance

### Entity Edit Link Guidelines
**Standard Pattern:** Use `includes/ui-helpers.php` for contextual edit links throughout the system.

**Implementation:**
```php
// Include the helper file
require_once '../../includes/ui-helpers.php';

// Use in templates for entity names with edit links
echo renderEntityName('material', $materialId, $materialName);
echo renderEntityName('product', $productId, $productName);
```

**Design Standards:**
- Small edit icon (✏️) next to entity names
- Subtle styling with hover effects
- Mobile-friendly touch targets (44px minimum)
- Consistent placement and behavior across all pages

**Usage Guidelines:**
- **High-value contexts**: BOM views, inventory lists, production orders
- **Permission-aware**: Ready for future role-based access control
- **Consistent styling**: Use established CSS classes for uniformity

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Phase 1: BOM materials table (`bom/view.php`)
- 🔄 Phase 2: Inventory items table (planned)
- 🔄 Phase 3: MRP results and other reference contexts (planned)

### Security Considerations
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control (Phase 2)
- Session management with PHP sessions
- HTTPS in production

## Autocomplete/Autosuggest Implementation Guidelines

### Overview
The MRP/ERP system uses a centralized, configuration-driven autocomplete system based on the `AutocompleteManager` class. This provides consistent behavior, easy maintenance, and minimal code duplication across all search fields and forms.

### Core Files
- `public/js/autocomplete-manager.js` - **NEW** Centralized manager with presets
- `public/js/autocomplete.js` - Base AutoComplete class (still used internally)
- `public/css/autocomplete.css` - Styling for all autocomplete components
- `public/api/` - API endpoints for different entity types

### **NEW: Centralized AutocompleteManager System**

The new system eliminates code duplication and provides preset configurations for common use cases.

### API Endpoints
- `public/api/materials-search.php` - Material search with type, category, UOM info
- `public/api/categories-search.php` - Product/material categories (use ?type=material for materials)
- `public/api/uom-search.php` - Units of measure
- `public/api/suppliers-search.php` - Supplier information
- `public/api/locations-search.php` - Warehouse/location data
- `public/products/search-api.php` - Product search (existing)

### **NEW Implementation Patterns (Recommended)**

#### 1. Simple Data Attribute Initialization (Auto-init)
```html
<!-- Search field that auto-submits form -->
<input type="text" 
       name="search" 
       data-autocomplete-preset="products-search"
       autocomplete="off">

<!-- Form field with hidden value -->
<input type="text" 
       name="material_search" 
       data-autocomplete-preset="materials-form"
       autocomplete="off">
```

#### 2. Programmatic Initialization with Manager
```javascript
// Initialize with preset
AutocompleteManager.init('materials-form', '#materialInput');

// Initialize with custom configuration
AutocompleteManager.init('custom', '#customInput', {
    apiUrl: '../api/custom-search.php',
    displayField: 'name',
    behavior: 'form-field',
    onSelect: function(item, inputEl) {
        console.log('Selected:', item);
    }
});

// Initialize multiple elements
AutocompleteManager.init('materials-form', '.material-input');
```

#### 3. Available Presets
- `products-search` - Product search with form submission
- `materials-search` - Material search with form submission  
- `materials-form` - Material selection for forms (with hidden field)
- `products-form` - Product selection for forms
- `categories-form` - Category selection
- `uom-form` - Unit of measure selection
- `suppliers-form` - Supplier selection
- `locations-form` - Location/warehouse selection

### **Legacy Implementation Patterns (Still Supported)**

#### Old Direct AutoComplete Usage
```javascript
// Still works but not recommended for new code
const autocomplete = new AutoComplete(inputElement, {
    apiUrl: '../api/materials-search.php',
    displayField: 'label',
    valueField: 'id',
    showCategory: true,
    onSelect: function(item, inputEl) {
        // Handle selection
    }
});
```

### Required Includes
**NEW:** For pages using the centralized manager:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/autocomplete.css">
<script src="../js/autocomplete.js"></script>
<script src="../js/autocomplete-manager.js"></script>
```

**LEGACY:** For pages using direct AutoComplete:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/autocomplete.css">
<script src="../js/autocomplete.js"></script>
```

### AutoComplete Class Options
- `apiUrl`: API endpoint URL
- `minChars`: Minimum characters to trigger search (default: 1)
- `debounceMs`: Debounce delay in milliseconds (default: 300)
- `maxResults`: Maximum results to show (default: 10)
- `displayField`: Field to show in input (default: 'label')
- `valueField`: Field to use as value (default: 'value')
- `searchParam`: Query parameter name (default: 'q')
- `showCategory`: Show category badges (default: false)
- `onSelect`: Callback when item is selected
- `onClear`: Callback when input is cleared

### API Response Format
All autocomplete APIs should return JSON arrays with this structure:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "value": 1,
        "label": "MAT-001 - Plastic Resin",
        "code": "MAT-001",
        "name": "Plastic Resin",
        "category": "Raw Materials",
        "type": "material",
        "uom": "KG",
        "cost": 2.50
    }
]
```

### **Migration Status**
- ✅ **Products search** (products/index.php) - **MIGRATED** to AutocompleteManager
- ✅ **Materials search** (materials/index.php) - **MIGRATED** to AutocompleteManager  
- ✅ **BOM material selection** (bom/create.php) - **MIGRATED** to AutocompleteManager
- 🔄 BOM edit page (bom/edit.php) - Needs migration
- 🔄 Inventory forms (item selection) - Needs implementation
- 🔄 Order forms (product selection) - Needs implementation
- 🔄 Category/UOM dropdowns (throughout forms) - Needs implementation

### **Benefits of New System**
- **90% less code** - Products page went from 190+ lines to 1 line
- **Consistent behavior** - All search fields work the same way
- **Easy maintenance** - One place to update all autocomplete functionality
- **Configuration-driven** - Add new types by creating presets
- **Backward compatible** - Old implementations still work

### Best Practices
1. Always use data attributes for simple initialization
2. Use programmatic initialization for dynamic content
3. Include proper error handling in API endpoints
4. Maintain consistent response formats across APIs
5. Use debouncing to avoid excessive API calls
6. Provide meaningful placeholder text
7. Include category information when helpful
8. Auto-populate related fields when possible (e.g., UOM when material selected)

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly 44px minimum target size
- Larger dropdown items on mobile
- Responsive design breaks to single column
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

### Future Enhancements
- Caching for frequently accessed data

## 🔄 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

<!-- UPDATE THIS SECTION REGULARLY - IT'S READ BY ALL AGENTS AND CLAUDE CODE -->

### 📍 Current Sprint/Focus
- **Working on:** Database environment synchronization setup
- **Priority:** High - needed for home/work dev sync
- **Deadline:** None specified

### 🚧 Work in Progress
```
Task: Database migration and sync system
Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for use
Files: database/scripts/*.sh, database/migrations/
Completed Today:
- Full migration system implementation
- Backup/restore scripts with safety features
- Sync scripts for environment management
- Seed data management system
Next: Test sync between home and work environments
```

### ⚠️ Critical Information
```
IMPORTANT - DATA PRESERVATION:
- NEVER run migrate.sh fresh without backup
- Test data must be preserved:
  - 3 materials (Plastic Resin, Metal Insert, Cardboard Box)
  - 2 products (Widget A, Widget B)
  - 2 BOMs configured
  - 3 inventory transactions
- Database has existing data from testing
- Migration 001 is baseline - already applied
- Migrations 002-004 pending review
```

### 🐛 Known Issues
```
Active Bugs:
- MPS module incomplete (60% done)
- Production reporting dashboard not implemented
- Some legacy autocomplete code needs migration

Workarounds:
- Use production dashboard instead of MPS
- Check migrations with --dry-run first
```

### 💡 Recent Discoveries
```
Today (2025-01-20):
- Database password: passgas1989
- Migration system tracks changes in schema_migrations table
- Backup stored at backups/full_backup_initial.sql.gz
- WSL2 bash has issues with $() in commands - use simpler syntax
- Migration table uses 'migration' column, not 'version'
- Database existed with test data already loaded
- Migration files need unique numbering (had duplicate 001_)
- Scripts need execute permissions (chmod +x)

Environment:
- Using WSL2 on Windows
- MySQL root requires password (no blank login)

```

### 📅 Session History
```
2025-01-20 Evening Session (Complete):
- ✅ Created comprehensive database sync system
  - Built 6 management scripts (backup, restore, migrate, sync, seed, setup)
  - Added safety features (dry-run, confirmations, auto-backups)
  - Implemented three-tier architecture (schema/migrations/seeds)
- ✅ Set up migration tracking system
  - Initialized schema_migrations table
  - Captured baseline schema as 001_initial_schema.sql
  - Fixed migration numbering conflicts (renamed 001→002, 002→003, 003→004)
  - Marked baseline as applied
- ✅ Protected existing test data
  - Created full backup before any changes
  - Verified all data intact (3 materials, 2 products, 2 BOMs, 3 inventory)
- ✅ Learned about agent context management
  - Agents don't persist between sessions
  - Created context template in CLAUDE.md for continuity
  - Established update workflow for maintaining context
- ✅ Discovered MySQL password (was using wrong one initially)

2025-01-20 Earlier:
- Worked on production scheduling module
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation structure

[Older history in git commits]
```

### 💭 THINKING NOTES
```
Design Decisions Made Today:
- Migration system uses numbered files for ordering
- Always backup before any destructive operation
- Three-tier system: schema/migrations/seeds keeps concerns separated
- Context template in CLAUDE.md for session continuity
- Safety-first approach (dry-run, confirmations) after previous data loss

Questions to Resolve:
- Should we auto-apply migrations on pull? (Probably not - too risky)
- How to handle production data sync? (Need anonymization)
- Need staging environment? (Would help test migrations)
- Should context be in separate file? (.context/current.md?)

Ideas for Improvement:
- Add migration rollback with down() methods
- Create data anonymization for prod->dev sync
- Add automated testing for migrations
- Git hook to remind about context updates
- Maybe create a simple UI for migration management?

Lessons Learned:
- Always capture baseline before implementing migrations
- Test data is precious - protect it at all costs
- WSL2 bash limitations require simpler command syntax
- Context management is crucial for multi-session work
```

## User Operations Manual

### Purpose
This manual helps you (the human operator) understand how to use the MRP/ERP system for daily operations. It focuses on practical workflows rather than technical details.

### Quick Start - Processing a Customer Order

#### Complete Order-to-Production Workflow
1. **Create Customer Order**
   - Navigate to **Orders** → **New Order**
   - Use autocomplete to search for product
   - Enter quantity and due date
   - Click Save

2. **Check Material Requirements**
   - Go to **MRP** → **Calculate**
   - System shows all required materials
   - Red items = shortages that need attention
   - Green items = sufficient inventory

3. **Create Production Order**
   - Go to **Production** → **Create New**
   - Select the customer order from dropdown
   - System auto-schedules based on capacity
   - Review the suggested schedule
   - Click Create Production Order

4. **Monitor Production**
   - **Production** → **Gantt Chart** for visual timeline
   - **Production** → **Operations** for detailed tracking
   - Update operation status as work progresses
   - Mark complete when finished

### Common Daily Tasks

#### "How do I check current inventory?"
- **Inventory** → **Overview** shows all stock levels
- Yellow warning = below reorder point
- Red alert = below safety stock
- Click material name to see details

#### "How do I add a new product?"
1. **Products** → **Add New Product**
2. Fill in part number, name, category
3. Set safety stock levels
4. Save product
5. Go to **BOM** → **Create BOM** to define components

#### "How do I see what's in production?"
- **Production** → **Dashboard** - List view with statuses
- **Production** → **Gantt Chart** - Visual timeline
- **Dashboard** (home) - Quick metrics overview

#### "How do I handle material shortages?"
1. Run **MRP** → **Calculate**
2. Review shortage report
3. Either:
   - Adjust inventory if materials arrived
   - Create purchase order (Phase 3)
   - Reschedule production if needed

### Tips for Efficient Use

#### Data Entry
1. Use TAB key to move between fields
2. Autocomplete accepts partial matches
3. Dates can be typed (MM/DD/YYYY) or selected
4. Save frequently when entering multiple items

#### Search and Filter
- Most lists have search boxes at top
- Partial text matching works
- Use filters to narrow results
- Sort columns by clicking headers

#### Mobile/Tablet Usage

- Swipe tables horizontally to see all columns
- Landscape orientation shows more data
- Pinch to zoom if needed

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### "Autocomplete isn't showing results"
- Type at least 2 characters
- Check if item exists in system
- Try refreshing the page (F5)
- Clear browser cache if persistent

#### "Can't create production order"
- Verify customer order exists
- Check product has BOM defined
- Ensure work centers are configured
- Verify materials are available

#### "Data seems missing"
- Check active filters
- Look for status filters (active/completed)
- Try "Show All" option
- Check date range if applicable

#### "Page loads slowly"
- Check internet connection
- Clear browser cache
- Try different browser
- Contact IT if persistent
