## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

### ⚠️ Critical Setup Required

The database schema exists but tables need to be created. Execute the following command immediately:

```bash
mysql -u root -p mrp_erp < database/schema.sql
```

### Setup Checklist

1. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p mrp_erp < database/schema.sql
   ```

2. **Load Test Data (Optional):**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p mrp_erp < database/test_data_simple.sql
   ```

3. **Configuration Files:**
   - Verify `.env` file exists with correct database credentials
   - Check `config/database.php` matches your environment
   - Set appropriate file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
